# Is this page for you?

[Download the latest Total Replay II disk image](https://archive.org/details/TotalReplay2) at the archive.org home page if you just want to play Apple II sports games. The rest of this page is for developers who want to work with the source code and assemble it themselves.

This fork is purely for me to work with the source code and contribute changes back to 4am's main repository.

There should be no need for anyone else to use this repository.
